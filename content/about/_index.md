# ABOUT US
NCS Green Earth Pvt Ltd is a Bio Technology company incorporated in 2009. Three Musketeers came together sharing an ethical bond and with the firm belief that Bio-Technology can boost the sustainability & profitability of Indian Agriculture.


With the focus on better way of Soil & Fertility enhancement, Nutrition & Stress Management and Pest & Disease management, NCS Crop Science developed an impressive range of products and took it to the market. Excellent results with environmental safety made the demand soar with all kind of farmers. The innovation proved that it’s possible to switch to organic without increasing the cost and compromising on productivity. Providing environmental benefits on top of commercial sense.


In July 2015, the company decided to expand the horizon from only Agriculture to other aspects of life including bio-remediation, environmental science, industrial and commercial application. The company was suitably renamed to NCS Green Earth Pvt Ltd to go in sync with the new vision and the vocabulary at NCS Green Earth lavishly used Enzymes, Organic Acids, Bio-Secondary Metabolites, Bio-Nano Particles etc.


With our vision and dedication for innovation and continuous improvisation, our products have been certified by Ecocert and we have been granted ISO 9001:2008.

# Technology (Research & Development, IPR)

The core technology is focused around the action of beneficial microbes which in turn secretes certain enzymes, organic acids & growth hormones. To facilitate this process we master and innovate applied Submerged Fermentation (SMF) & Solid State Fermentation (SSF) as a production technique of biological conversion of complex substrate into simple compounds by various micro-organisms. Technological innovation is focused on effective use of the upstream process for initial formulation and downstream processes for recovery of products in pure state or separation.


The products so derived are then combined with other herbal & natural products to make efficient ready to use formulation that work in various niche environments for, nutrient rich organic manure, Bio-stimulants, Bio-fertilizers, Bio-Pesticides and for Solid waste Management.


Product development and process optimization forms the core goal of the R&D.
